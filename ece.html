        the technical challenges focused by the moutside world and the department provides concept-based learning,
        applied research, consultancy from the corporate, patents, and training in the field of Microelectronics Domain
        (SOC based software field), Application Domain (Embedded and IoT), Signal Processing using NI-LabVIEW, RF &
        Microwave Devices and Industrial Automation using PLC, HMI & Drives.

        Students in the Department undergo In-house industrial training to bridge the gap between Industry and Academia.
        Department of ECE has recently signed MoUs with True Chip, Automation Engineers A.B.PVT.Ltd, Optimum Viking
        Satcom (India) Pvt Ltd, Marvel Innovative systems & Technology etc. for industry-based consultancy and projects.

        The Department also has Industry Collaboration Cell to provide a platform for our students to develop a relevant
        skill set and know-how for better placement related to skill set industries.

        The Department provides guidance to students to develop products based on ideas received from industries and
        create an in-house ecosystem, encouraging industrial exposure to students’ product development at the college
        level to make them industry ready and globally competent.
